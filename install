Requirements:
- any LAMP powered host, which permits shell scripts;
- perl interpeter with mysql, DBI, xmltv modules/extensions;
- valid XMLTV source.

Installation:
- extract/copy files somewhere;
- create empty mysql DB with provided schema, create DB user, grant permissions;
- check/fix db/username/password in php/database.inc.php and xmltv-import.pl;
- check/fix files path/names in epg-gen.sh and php/database.inc.php;
- if you need a test run, use reference xml files as source.

Run epg-gen.sh and wait - on large datasets it really take some time, most of spend in xmltv-import.pl.
