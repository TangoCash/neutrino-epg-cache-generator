Long story short: on many satellites EPG do not transmitted in transport stream,
but "a certain man always strive for the best" - so many people collect EPG data
from different sources in various ways.
On Enigma powered satellite STBs this problem was solved a long ago, and now
exist many plugins which fetch EPG data from different online sources.

This project tries to solve same problem for Neutrino powered boxes, mostly
for Russian and Ukranian TV channels, but feel free to adapt it to your needs -
just find valid XMLTV source.
